## Environmental Summary
- Climate: Comparable to early Pliocene-Eocene warm periods; global warmth with polar ice remnants
- Precipitation: Higher than Earth's average, especially around the equator and temperate rainforests
- Ocean Currents: Strong equatorial currents with intense upwelling; numerous gyres influence regional climates
- Wind Patterns: Driven by Earth-like Coriolis effect; Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrates strongly
