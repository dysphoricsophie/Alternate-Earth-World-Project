**Description:**  
The Pachis Supergroup is derived from westward migration of the same Asyroid-related southern migrator stock. It comprises populations adapted to varied climates: high-altitude cold (Swanzids), temperate plains (Tumbanids), tropical rainforest (Lirongids), and island/coastal environments (Bornids). Sexual dimorphism is minimal across all groups, with environmental pressures shaping stature, limb length, nasal morphology, and skin pigmentation. Cultural practices (pastoralism, maritime navigation) reinforced occupational specialization without inducing sexual dimorphism.

**Trait Overview:**
- **Nose:** Swanzids: broad, straight; Tumbanids/Bornids: medium, straight; Lirongids: medium, slightly broad
- **Eye Type:** Almond-shaped, slightly hooded in some highland and rainforest populations
- **Eye Color:** Dark brown dominant; occasional amber in highlands
- **Body Build:** Swanzids: stocky/brachyskelic; Tumbanids: mesomorphic/linear; Lirongids: lean-mesomorphic; Bornids: lean-mesomorphic, slightly longer limbs
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Minimal
- **Lips:** Medium-full; slightly thinner in highlands
- **Hair Type:** Coarse, straight to slightly wavy
- **Hair Color:** Black/dark brown
- **Facial Hair Type & Growth:** Sparse; minimal across sexes
- **Skin Color:** Swanzids/Tumbanids: light olive; Lirongids/Bornids: medium bronze
- **Head Shape & Size:** Oval to broad; brachycephalic in Swanzids; oval in others
- **Distinctive Traits:** Highland populations show robust bone density; rainforest populations have slender extremities and thermoregulatory adaptations; coastal Bornids have longer limbs and dexterity adaptations for island life
