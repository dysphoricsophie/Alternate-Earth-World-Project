**Description:**  
The Dur-Ti Supergroup is a widespread riverine and floodplain population derived from Asyroid ancestry. Core populations (Shushazids, Harazids, Uhanids, Southern Shushazids) share minimal sexual dimorphism, mesomorphic builds, and strong craniofacial uniformity, reflecting long-term sedentary agriculture, fishing, and riverine adaptation. Phenotypic lines appear along rivers, coasts, and floodplains due to admixture with neighboring populations (e.g., Uhanids, Southern Shushazids).

**Trait Overview:**
- **Nose:** Medium width, straight to slightly concave or convex; broader in southern floodplain populations
- **Eye Type:** Almond-shaped, deep-set; minor hooding southward
- **Eye Color:** Dark brown dominant; amber/light hazel minor (~10–15%)
- **Body Build:** Lean-mesomorphic; regional variation along rivers; low endurance selection pressure for navigation
- **Sexual Dimorphism:** Minimal
- **Lips:** Medium-full, defined Cupid’s bow
- **Hair Type:** Moderately coarse, straight to slightly wavy
- **Hair Color:** Black/dark brown dominant, chestnut/copper highlights minor
- **Facial Hair Type & Growth:** Sparse to moderate; males only
- **Skin Color:** Light olive to medium bronze; darker in southern floodplain and coastal zones
- **Head Shape & Size:** Oval to oval-diamond, moderate cranial size; slight brachycephaly in some populations
- **Distinctive Traits:** Subtle epicanthic folds in southern Uhanid and southern Shushazid populations; golden iris flecks common in bright light; strong adaptive immunity to waterborne pathogens
