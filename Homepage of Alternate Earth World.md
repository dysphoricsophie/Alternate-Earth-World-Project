>[!info-breakdown]+ **General World Lore**
>This world diverges *(very unrealistically)* from our timeline at 2.5 billion years ago when the continent of [***Vaalbara***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaalbara) finished formation. In this world, the continents formed another way with a different set of continental stresses which forms the basis of the new continental shelves which would bring it to this point. Now for the unrealistic part, all earth evolution happened the same with the same evolution but arranged in such a way that the species of our world evolve in ***EXACTLY THE SAME*** way as on earth. However, the second and only true meaningful divergence from this timeline happens around 150,000 years ago where humans and their influence on the environemnets they encounter will begin to affect their future history. This is going to be the official reason why until i find a better scenario / idea to fill in the gap of the forever question of worldbuilding: *~={red}"Why are there humans?"

>[!info-breakdown]+ **Current Geopolitical Situation**
>The geopolitical situation of this world is very fragile and looks like it will soon topple over. Instability plagues this world's geopolitical landscape.
>The Tsardom of Oxlightia fights its old rival, the Kingdom of Lostsia, who had taken a severe defeat almost a century earlier when the Karol the Great won the colonial war in Auresland against Lostsian colonial garrisons and permanently took the Lostsian holdings in the continent.
>Elsewhere, the reborn Darkhan Empire attempts to subdue the women of its society, who, for long held the top spot of the social hierarchy as high matriarchs of the godess of the eastern sun, Nunduth. However, by a coup in the fragile Darkhan state by cultist elements of the Cult of Siradab, Nunduth's consort husband declared the godess impure and her worship illegal. Ever since the Darkhan people have spiralled into despair and hatred. 
>The most recent escalations of this hatred include the purported genocide of Berkh & Phong People within the Darkhan state which forced the Ubang-Jusari & Yafat provinces to unilaterally declare their secession from the Darkhan confederate state, the beginning of Segeizian intervention in Darkhan State Affairs along with the start of the Great War of National Destruction against ethe Grand Duchy of Morama.
>Further east to the Darkhan Nightmare State, another great power has collapsed, the long revered Grand Toprish Zhurakate. For decades before, the ruling dynasty had been weakened by a series of child emperors who were increasingly influenced by the imperial court which eventually lead to the dynasty's ousting and collapse. Out of the chaos of the collapse of one of the oldest civilisations on earth came the warlord era which persists to this day, regional military warlords seized control of their local military district and though violence, coercion or both, managed to pull together a swath of territory under their control, declaring themselves true successor to the former Zhurakate's dynasty.
>South is the Keseki-Fungian conflict over ownership over the islands of the Crosutine & Xanthenine Oceans. Despite the two originating form the same state (The Darkhan Confederation) they both took wildly different paths. Keseki became a market democracy and Fingia became an authoritarian, fundamentalist state that believes in its right to won the passages betwween the two oceans.
>Further south, you have the split of the personal union of Longhia-Vallalur after the death of the Queen Yuzai III. Due to her sudden death, she had no will which left her two sons, Thorak and Zhyran to fighting over her mother's realm. They split both the country and the royal house in two, restoring the two separate houses of Longhia & Vallalur with their realms being named through the same convention.
>Westwards to the collapsed zhurakates, you have an active crusade going on. The metvinese crusade
