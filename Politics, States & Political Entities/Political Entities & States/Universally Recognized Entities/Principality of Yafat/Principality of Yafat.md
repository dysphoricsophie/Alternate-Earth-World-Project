Unlike Ubang-Jusari, the Principality of Yafat’s journey through independence was far rougher. The young nation chose to restore a compromise with the old nobility from before the Grand Confederation, integrating them into a democratic system. In hindsight, that might’ve been a mistake. Ubang-Jusari’s pivot toward more left-leaning, internationalist policies earned it the backing of one of the strongest economies on Earth, the Segiezian Union.

Yafat, on the other hand, received no such help. It was left to try to untangle itself from the regime in Kardagan. As a result, it fell behind its coeval and went through several riots and coups aimed at curbing the increasingly strong noble influence.

Weakened by years of mostly non-violent internal strife, the country now seems trapped in its contradictions. How and when will it be able to look outward again? Will it ever break through whatever appears to be haunting it?
