The Trolenian Zhurakate has always been the background character of the region â€” the benchwarmer, the unlucky side actor in the grand theatre of power. Misfortune has followed it for generations, with the most recent calamity being the eruption of Mount Sallager in the northern provinces.

No more.

With the collapse of the Toprish Zhurakate, the Zhurak of Trolenia has dismissed the nominal civilian government and called for an assembly of military leaders drawn from knightly bloodlines. Their mission is clear: seize as much territory as possible from the fragmented warlord states that once belonged to the great Zhurakate.

Despite this bold move, Trolenia remains one of the weakest players across the plains. It suffers from a lack of access to the open ocean, a relatively low population, and limited urban development. The state has also failed to properly integrate its population into a functioning national apparatus. There is no centralised education system, no cohesive patriotic vision, and little sense of unity. As a result, the Zhurakate must either rely on conscripts unwilling to fight or invest heavily in a slow and costly effort to inspire national identity. The knightly leadership, trained in battle but not in administration or propaganda, is poorly suited for such a task.

This is the Trolenian dilemma: either reinstate the militarily inept civilian government, or keep the politically inept knightly class in charge and hope they can steer the nation through the storm. One way or another, time is running out, and a decision must be made.
