The Yazyurt Horde is a state formed through the efforts of Segiezian colonists who went rogue due to the harsh weather conditions and a deep desire to preserve the local cultures. Isolated and cut off from the Union, these settlers abandoned their original mission and embraced the customs of the indigenous population around them. The Horde is ruled by an ethnic minority descended from colonists who openly adopted the language, traditions, and tribal structures of their subjects. This arrangement is similar to the rule of the Yuan Dynasty or the Mughal Empire, where the foreign rulers maintained power by adopting local customs and traditions.

The horde is governed by a combination of advanced bureaucratic procedures and traditional tribal customs of the ethnically indigenous population. National assemblies are held in meetings under open, igloo-style structures, as per tradition, but the procedures are carried out on advanced computers inherited from the Segiezian colonisation efforts. These systems are maintained by a small group of trained officials who are fluent in both cultures, allowing the Horde to manage records, communications, and governance efficiently.

In this way, the Yazyurt Horde unites modern technology with tribal customs, creating a unique political order. It stands as a hybrid state where a minority rules through respect for local traditions, utilising inherited tools to govern effectively in a harsh and challenging environment.
