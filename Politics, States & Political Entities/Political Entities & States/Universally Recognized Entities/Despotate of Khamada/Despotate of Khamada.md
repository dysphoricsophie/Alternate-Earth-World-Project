This polar state is a true example of resilience. Despite the freezing temperatures, Khamada lives on, and it even thrives in what is the most inhospitable organised state on earth. No one, except for the tribes of the unorganised tribes, lives at a higher altitude than where Khamada is situated.

The fact that almost all of Khamada is a frigid wasteland also means that no nation would ever try to invade and conquer it, due to the logistical issues with transporting food and material so far north and because soldiers would not be acclimated to the weather. Thus, Khamada only needs to keep a decent army, navy and air force despite bordering the Holy Darkhan Empire. Even they would not want to take over these lands.
