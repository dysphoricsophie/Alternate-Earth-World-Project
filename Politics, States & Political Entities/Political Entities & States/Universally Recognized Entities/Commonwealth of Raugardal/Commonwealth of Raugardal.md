The Commonwealth is a vast, frozen nation with the second-lowest population of any country in the world. Its culture is highly diverse, with no dominant religion or cultural group, aside from the sparse Euskati in the far north.

The government has remained in power for the last thirty years in its current form, largely due to the popularity of its national policies. It follows what it refers to as Socialist Realism, where private property is not abolished but instead leased to private companies, which nominally hold no control over the means of production. Combined with the country's extremely low population density, this makes it relatively easy for the government to provide free housing and education, assuming local administrations and tribal units contribute.

The nation has no standing army, navy, or air force. This is mainly due to the small size of the population. The government considers a permanent armed force unnecessary, as the country has never been invaded in its history, and its large, well-developed police regiments and coast guard units are seen as sufficient to maintain internal order.
