The western zhurakates are in a precarious situation. After the fall of the previous dynasty, each provincial military leader took control of the units stationed in their province and declared themselves zhurak of the whole empire. They still fly their unit emblem animal on their flag, inspired by the high command flag of the old dynasty. Although descended from the same state with the same legal system, their methods of governance vary from warlord to warlord. Some take care of their subjects, some focus on military affairs only, while others rely on banditry and strong-armed tactics to intimidate the population into submission. It will take an experienced and worthy warlord to reunify the old territories of the Great Toprish Zhurakate.

The Barian Zhurakate is similar to most of the other zhurakates. A military leader of the Barian regions takes control of the local army and rules the state through martial law over their citizens. Despite this, the Zhurak of Baria still has some curveballs to throw, such as his surprisingly democratic system of census democracy in which the various local military leaders of the state vote on referendum reforms, much like officials representing their own region. These representatives are sometimes elected by the people if the local military officer decides to accept the popular sentiment and resign.
