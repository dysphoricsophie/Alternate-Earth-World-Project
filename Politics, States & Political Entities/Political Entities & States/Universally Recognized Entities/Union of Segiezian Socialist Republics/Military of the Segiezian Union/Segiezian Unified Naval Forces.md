The **Segiezian Unified Naval Forces** (SNF) is the major naval force of the Segeizian Union. It operates over 712 combat vessels and commands more than 280,000 men across 4 oceans, covering one continent's coastline. Its large amount of ships allows it to project power globally. Recently, at the advice of General **Alexander Jugens** & Admiral **Jaur Vort**, the union's naval doctrine has shifted to a more carrier-centric, maneuver warfare strategy. It is divided into two theaters (Northern and Southern) and consists of two high seas fleet (**1st Northern** & **2nd Southern High Seas Fleet**) and of two submarine fleets (**1st Northern** & **2nd Southern Submarine Fleet**). 

Ships of the Segiezian Union are marked with different prefixes depending on their purpose. Large ships like Aircraft Carriers, Helicopter Carriers and Battleships are given the prefix ***USR*** (abbr. of the country name), medium size and small ships like Battlecruisers, Cruisers, Destroyers and Frigates are given the prefix ***HCS*** (Honorable Commissioned Ship) while submarines are given the prefix ***SMV*** (Special Marine Vehicle). 

Here is a breakdown of the major fleet organizations of the Segiezian Naval Forces:

##### Corruption Contrevercies:
Analysts note that while the Segiezian Navy remains one of the worldâ€™s largest, portions of its fleet are composed of vessels designed in the 1940s and 1950s, making it less modernized compared to some contemporary forces. Additionally, the navy's continued operation of battleships and battlecruisers leave the overall naval structure less maneuverable than contemporary fleets. This is, in part, due to the corruption of **Admiral Alfred A. Sauernbreker**. The Admiral has ties with corruption and nepotism in the military and has profited from the attempts by the wealthier **Ernego Pirate groups** to pay him to turn a blind eye to the frequent pirate raids in the Western region. He is also responsible for the **Ernego Pirates** enlarging their fleet five-fold due to him selling old & unfinished ship hulls to the at a premium. This allowed the **Ernego Pirates** to obtain modern submarine technology which aided them in their raids.
