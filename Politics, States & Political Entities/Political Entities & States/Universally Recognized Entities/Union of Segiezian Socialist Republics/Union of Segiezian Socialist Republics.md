The **Segiezian Union**, officially the _Union of Segiezian Socialist Republics_, is a federal socialist state covering the entire **Nedirean Continent**. The Segiezian Union borders the **Aetine Ocean** (*south*), **Celatic Ocean** (*west*), **Xanthenine Ocean** (*east*), and **Gandic Ocean** (*north*). With a land area of 12.33 million square kilometres and a population of over 910 million, it is the one of the largest states in the world. The Union was formally established by the **Treaty of Ziortsa** (1958), which ended the Great War and recognised the Union as the successor state to the **United Kingdoms of Pamoriatsa, Asko and the Captaincy of Mistemormon**.

The official language of the Union is **Bitiasau**, with the **Zinari Bitiasau** dialect serving as the standard for government and education. Bitiasau itself exists on a continuum, with **Zinari Bitiasau** and **Igniazi Bitiasau** forming the two main poles of a dialect gradient. Speakers of each branch are mutually intelligible within their groups, while comprehension across branches increases with geographic proximity; within roughly 150 kilometres, speech differences fade to the point that the dialects effectively merge.

The Union is governed through the **Committee for Central Organization**, which drafts and enforces four-year economic and political plans. Its chairman functions as the de facto head of state, while the official head of state retains a supervisory role overseeing government processes. A bicameral parliament operates alongside the **Committee**, with the **National Congress** (*Lower House*) composed of delegates elected from towns and municipalities and the **Republican Congress** (*Upper House*) made of two elected representatives from each of the 24 republics and represent the interests of the republics in parliament. In practice, this system has been marked by tension between the younger, reformist National Congress and the older, **Yereshadese-dominated Republican Congress**, leading to frequent political deadlock.

The Union played a leading role in early space exploration. It launched the world’s first artificial satellite in 1971, followed by the first human-crewed mission in 1973. Subsequent milestones included interplanetary probes, the establishment of a permanent orbital space station, and a lunar landing program in the early 1980s.

### History
---   
The **Segiezian Union** emerged from the collapse of the **Pamoriat-Asko United Kingdoms**, a dual monarchy formed in 1788 through dynastic union. Prolonged involvement in the **Great War (1942–1958)** against the **Grand Confederation of Darkhan Matriarchates** inflicted massive casualties and economic ruin, fueling unrest among the **Zinari People’s Liberation Front (ZPLF)** and other groups. On **15 June 1957**, mass demonstrations in **Mudare** escalated into revolt, resulting in the death of the royal family and the proclamation of a short-lived **Transitional Authority**. The ensuing **Black Hundred** saw widespread violence, failed military coups, and the disintegration of central command. Within seventy days, the **ZPLF** emerged victorious in a brief civil war. The conflict concluded with the **Treaty of Ziortsa (1958)**, which ended hostilities with Darkhan, dissolved the monarchy, and recognized the **Segiezian Union** as the successor state to the United Kingdoms.

#### History of the Pamoriat-Asko United Kingdoms
The **Pamoriat-Asko United Kingdoms** were established in **1788** through the dynastic marriage of **Queen Almare of Pamoriatza** and **Prince Irenos of Asko**. Their union created the **House of Pamoriat-Asko**, consolidating the two crowns under a single dynasty while preserving separate administrative traditions. The new monarchy brought together two very different peoples: the **Zinari**, who were native to the continent and formed the vast majority of the population, and the **Yereshadese**, a minority elite whose ancestors had migrated from the Darkhan continent centuries earlier. 
Although the Zinari accounted for roughly four-fifths of the realm’s inhabitants, political authority was concentrated in the hands of the Yereshadese nobility of Asko. This imbalance defined the monarchy’s structure from its inception. The Askonian court controlled taxation, military command, and foreign policy, while Zinari representatives held little more than ceremonial roles. Over time, this hierarchy produced sustained political and social tensions that would remain unresolved throughout the monarchy’s existence.
The United Kingdoms pursued a policy of alliance with the **Tsardom of Oxlightia**, which became their principal partner in continental conflicts. While this alliance elevated the monarchy’s position in regional power politics, it also drew the state into costly wars. These external engagements, combined with unresolved internal divisions, weakened the stability of the kingdom and created the conditions for its eventual collapse.

##### Subjugation of the Kingdom of Pamoriatza
Although the 1788 dynastic union formally recognized Pamoriatza and Asko as equal crowns, the balance of power quickly shifted to Asko. State institutions, including the treasury, judiciary, and military command, were centralized in **Mudare**, the Askonian capital. Pamoriatza’s traditional assemblies were reduced in authority, and its aristocracy saw its influence eroded in favor of Askonian administrators. 
Throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries, efforts to defend Pamoriatza’s autonomy were repeatedly suppressed. Petitions for constitutional guarantees were ignored, while local attempts at reform were obstructed by Askonian officials. As a result, Pamoriatza’s position came this: a crown nominally equal in status, but increasingly subordinated in practice. The subordination of Pamoriatza also had cultural dimensions. Askonian customs and language were promoted in court and administration, while Zinari cultural institutions in Pamoriatza were marginalized. Critics within Pamoriatza described the monarchy as a form of internal colonization, arguing that the region was systematically stripped of political independence and economic resources.
By the early 20th century, Pamoriatza was firmly established as the junior partner in the monarchy. Its elites retained local powers but exercised little influence over the direction of the state. This imbalance deepened resentment among both the nobility and the broader population, reinforcing the view that Pamoriatza had been annexed in all but name.

##### Zinari Struggle for Representation
The Zinari, who made up the overwhelming majority of the United Kingdoms’ population, faced systemic discrimination under Askonian Yereshadese rule. Despite their numerical dominance, Zinari communities were excluded from meaningful political participation. Representation in the royal assemblies was disproportionately allocated to Askonian nobles, and Zinari leaders were denied access to senior offices in government or the military. Zinari populations were also subjected to economic and social inequalities. They carried heavier tax burdens than Yereshadese subjects and faced conscription quotas that demanded a greater share of military recruits. Many Zinari villages reported shortages of able-bodied men during wartime, as entire generations were drawn into the army. In addition, legal codes in Zinari provinces were often applied more harshly, reinforcing perceptions of second-class status.

Throughout the 19th century, Zinari discontent manifested in recurring cycles of protest and repression. Demonstrations in the 1830s and 1850s were violently suppressed, while the **Mudare Massacre of 1874**, in which royal troops fired on unarmed Zinari demonstrators demanding constitutional reform, left several hundred dead. This event became a rallying point for subsequent generations of activists and was cited by many as proof that peaceful protest would not achieve change.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the struggle for Zinari representation gave rise to organized movements. Some, such as the **Union for National Representation** (*UNR*), pursued gradual reform through petitions and negotiations. Others, including the **Zinari People’s Liberation Front** (*ZPLF*), adopted increasingly radical positions, combining labor strikes with acts of political violence. Underground presses circulated anti-monarchist pamphlets, while Zinari youth groups became hubs for nationalist sentiment.
By the 1930s, these movements had gained broad popular support across Zinari-majority regions. The monarchy’s failure to implement concessions strengthened the belief that only revolutionary action could secure equality. This radicalization set the stage for the decisive role played by the **ZPLF** and its allies in the unrest of the **Great War** (*1942–1958*) and in the eventual collapse of the monarchy itself.

#### Entry into the Great War
The **Pamoriat–Asko United Kingdoms** entered the **Great War (1942–1958)** after the **Grand Confederation of Darkhan Matriarchates** invaded the **High Matriarchate of Onenat**, a long-standing ally of the **Tsardom of Oxlightia**. Onenat was regarded as a crucial buffer state east of Oxlightia, and the invasion was perceived as a direct threat to Oxlightia’s continental security. Bound by treaty obligations, the Pamoriat–Asko monarchy declared war on Darkhan shortly after Oxlightia.

The opening years of the war proved catastrophic for Pamoriat–Asko. On the **Onenat Front**, more than three million soldiers were killed within the first three years as Darkhan forces advanced deep into continental territory. Despite these losses, the monarchy insisted on continuing the war, framing it as necessary to prevent Darkhan expansion across the continent.

By 1946 the conflict had shifted to the **southern Morama Peninsula**, within Darkhan territory. Alongside Oxlightian forces, Pamoriat–Asko launched an invasion that developed into a prolonged and attritional campaign. Fighting lasted thirteen years, during which between **two and four million additional soldiers** from Pamoriat–Asko were killed. The scale of casualties and the strain of prolonged warfare pushed the monarchy into economic exhaustion and demographic decline.

#### Civil Unrest & Riots
The losses sustained in the Great War had severe domestic repercussions. The **Zinari majority**, who constituted the bulk of conscripts, bore a disproportionate share of casualties. Combined with rising taxation, food shortages, and the absence of political representation, this led to widespread discontent.
By the early 1950s unrest had become pervasive. Movements such as the **Zinari People’s Liberation Front (ZPLF)** and the **Social National Trade Federation (SNTF)** gained prominence, uniting demands for an end to the war with long-standing calls for Zinari representation. Strikes and protests escalated into open riots across major cities.
Efforts by the monarchy to suppress the uprisings through arrests and military deployments proved ineffective and further radicalized opposition. The crisis culminated on **15 June 1957**, when more than one million protesters stormed the royal palace in **Mudare**, resulting in the deaths of the royal family and effectively abolishing the monarchy.

#### Transitional Authority of Pamoriat-Asko
Following the abolition of the monarchy in June 1957, surviving royal advisors and elements of the officer corps proclaimed the establishment of the **Transitional Authority of Pamoriat–Asko**. Martial law was declared across the kingdom, and the new government announced that emergency rule would continue until a suitable heir to the throne could be located or a permanent system of government established.

The Transitional Authority was composed of senior military commanders and remaining civil officials, who sought to maintain order while continuing the war effort against Darkhan. However, the Authority lacked legitimacy among much of the population, particularly the Zinari, who viewed it as a continuation of Askonian dominance. Its reliance on military coercion to suppress demonstrations further eroded public support.

#### The Black Hundread
In the 100 hours between **15 and 19 June 1957**, the period known as the **Black Hundred** unfolded. The collapse of central authority and the absence of effective policing resulted in widespread violence, looting, and mass reprisals across major cities. In Mudare and Pamoriatza, armed groups and mobs targeted government offices, businesses, and residences associated with the monarchy and nobility. Reports of sexual violence, killings, and indiscriminate reprisals were widespread.

The Black Hundred marked a decisive break with the old regime. Many of the remaining symbols of the monarchy were destroyed, and local military garrisons either mutinied or withdrew from the cities. By the end of the week, effective control had shifted to competing revolutionary and military factions.

#### Power Vacuum & Struggle
The collapse of the Transitional Authority left a significant power vacuum. Civilian factions aligned with the **ZPLF** competed with loyalist officers and provisional administrators for control of key territories. On the **Nediran continent**, surviving units of the Pamoriat–Asko Army attempted to stage a coup in favor of a restored military government but failed due to poor coordination and widespread desertion.
In the absence of a unified command, revolutionary groups organized armed militias. The **ZPLF** proved the most effective, mobilizing its supporters across urban centers and rural provinces. Within seventy days it succeeded in defeating rival factions in a short but intense civil conflict, consolidating control over the capital and major industrial regions.

#### Foundation of the Union State
On **1 September 1957**, the **Treaty of Ziortsa** formally ended hostilities between the revolutionary regime and the **Darkhan Confederation**, the reconstituted successor to the Grand Confederation of Matriarchates. The treaty recognized the new **Segiezian Union** as the legal successor to the **Pamoriat–Asko United Kingdoms** and marked the international acceptance of the revolutionary government. Under **ZPLF** leadership, the Segiezian Union retained much of the existing military high command until the conclusion of the war, after which several commanders were removed or placed on trial. The Union declared itself a federal socialist republic, with **Ziortsa** as its capital and a new constitution establishing collective institutions of governance.

### Geography
---   
The geography of the Segiezian Union is marked by the Ulbasa Mountain Range in the north of the continent. They and the surrounding highlands kept the large majority of the indigenous Zinari People south of the range. The highest point of the Ulbasa Mountains is the Mount Ulbasa at 2,280m in height. There are minor volcanoes in the highlands but they are all extinct.
#### Weather & Climate
Terrain, Rivers, Climate Zones, Natural Resources - and possible relation to military policies

#### Biomes & Ecosystems


### Government & Politics
---   
The Segiezian Union functions under the principle of democratic centralism. The **Committee for Central Organization** is the highest authority of state power, combining governmental and party functions. Composed of 9-10 members elected for five-year terms, the Committee directs economic planning through **Five-Year Plans**, amends legislation, and oversees constitutional changes.
#### Ideology & Political Thought
Until the tenure of Chairman Erik Sauernbreker, the nation's ideology was clearly laid out in the constitution. The previous Constitution of 1960 explicitly laid out the aim of the transitioning away from vanguard party authority to a fully communist society. However, due to Erik Sauernbreker's influence by the revisionist policies & ideals of the DUP (Democratic Union of Segiezia), he decided to amend the constitution to remove the explicit aim of achieving communism and rolled it back to trying to achieve a stable socialist system, abandoning (at least temporarily) communism as final goal of the nation.

#### All Union People's Party (AUPP)
The ruling party officially is the **All Union People's Party** (AUPP) established 15 May 1958 coinciding with the collapse of the Pamoriat-Asko United Kingdoms. Despite forming a single party officially, it is de facto split into three wings:
  - AUPP (Totalist)
  - AUPP (Syndicalist)
  - AUPP (Radical)
The **Totalist** wing which represents the right wing & conservative elements of the party and is mostly represented by the **Yereshadese Old Guard** of the **Republican Congress**. The totalists advocate for more authoritarian and pro market interpretation of socialism. They believe that markets can coexist somewhat with a socialist system and that through the gradual destruction of capitalism, not its revolutionary dismantlement, that the people and the nation can finally be freed.
The **Syndicalist** wing which represents the center wing elements of the party and is made of constantly shifting members who periodically may move left or right. It forms the unifying buffer between the two party wings. Historically, most chairmen of the **Committee for Central Organization** come from the syndicalist center block. They advocate for further decentralization of power into worker controlled unions that set national policies through governmental agency unions to represent the worker's interests in civil administration.
The **Radical Socialist** wing which represents the left wing / progressive elements of the party and are mostly represented in the young, **Zinari** members of the **National Congress**. It was historically the main wing of the party until 1962 when the primary split between it and the SDPS happened and the other factions formed as well. They advocate for a return to the revolutionary socialism seen right after the revolution with true worker ownership of the means of production.

#### Other Major Political Parties
Officially, other parties exist and are allowed to run for office but since the members of the **Committee for Central Organization** are chosen from the AUPP, other parties are functionally excluded form political decision making. Nevertheless, the other parties still retain a small but firm presence in the elections of the Union. Broadly, they can be categorized into several groups or coalitions: 
   - Democratic Union of Segiezia (DUS)
   - Social Democratic Party of Segiezia (SDPS)
   - Segiezian National Traditionalist Front (SNTF)
   - Constitutional Party of Pamoriat-Asko (UCPA-N)
   - United Crown Councils of Pamoriat-Asko (UCPA-R)
   - Yereshadese National Salvation Front (YNSF)
The **Democratic Union of Segiezia** (DUP) was established in 1973 by syndicalist AUPP members disillusioned by the shift of the party to a more nationalist election platform. It can be divided into two wings - the constitutionalists & democrats. The constitutionalists represent those who support the right of the original constitution of 1958 and want to return to the Pre-Sauernbreker era of the Union, economically they campaign for the return of what the union terms "Bourgeois Democracy" and aspire to have a strong market along with strong social safety nets. They have a large overlap with the Social Democratic Party fo Segiezia. The Democrats on the otherhand support the shift of the government to a more pro-market position but campaign for more economic deregulation to allow the markets to fully self correct and provide for all citizens of the Union. Recently, the ideals and theories of the democrats of the DUP have penetrated the members of the **Committee for Central Organization** with some of the key members of the committee having received some support through the DUP.

The **Social Democratic Party of Segiezia** was established in 1962. It was founded with the express aim to establish "Market Socialism", an ideology that would allow the markets to flourish while allowing the strong social policies & safety nets to persist. They believe in the collaboration of market forces and proletarian forces. This party's ideology is the inspiration for the system of governance practiced in **Ubang-Jusari**.

The **Segiezian National Traditionalist Front** (SNTF), formerly **National Conservative Party** (NCP) was established in 1948 as a "Nation Above All" party which advocates for a return to traditional values and a strict isolationist policy. It was formed as an opposition group to the war effort of the **Pamoriat-Asko United Kingdoms** in the **Great War** and often openly protested the war. More radical members sometimes engaged in military industrial sabotage, deserting, conscription-dodging & other anti-war, anti-intervention measures.

The **Constitutional Party of Pamoriat-Asko** (UCPA-N) and **United Crown Councils of Pamoriat-Asko** (UCPA-R) are the Noble and Royalist parties of Segiezia. They are the remaining elements of the pre-revolution society that re-emerged from hiding after the election of **Erik H. Sauernbreker** as chairman of the **Committee for Central Organization** due to his laxity on political restrictions and his family being descended from minor nobility. They advocate to a return of the nobility and rehabilitation of the royal members.

The **Yereshadese National Salvation Front** (YNSF) is a political party that is considered terrorist organization by the Union. It is an ultranationalist contingent of the old society back when the Zinari were enslaved and treated as second-class citizens. They advocate for strong corporations, minimal social aid, an interventionist foreign policy and a return of Zinari People to enslavement and servitude of the **Yersehadese race** as they constitute "prime physical form and peak mental fortitude".

#### Parliamentary System
The constitution of the Union outlines the creation of two parliamentary bodies; the Republican congress (Upper House) and National Congress (Lower House)

#### Foreign Relations
Military Aid, Guarantees, Alliances, Major conflicts, Territorial Disputes

#### Administrative Divisions
The union is functionally divided into 24 republics. As a stipulation of the **Treaty of Ziortsa**, each member republic reserves the right to secede from the union at any time.

### Military
---   
The Segiezian military consists of the **Segiezian Unified Armed Forces**, **Segiezian Unified Naval Forces**, **Segiezian Unified Aerial & Space Forces** and the **National Guard** under the direct command of **Committee for Central Organization** under normal circumstances as a counter-terrorism unit. The segiezian military fields nearly 2,300,000 men under arms and a further 3,120,000 men as reservists (not counting **National Guard** reservists).
#### Army
The **Segiezian Unified Armed Forces** (SAF) is the major ground force of the Segiezian Union. It relies on a strong infantry base for front line defense while having a substantial mechanized and armored forces to force frontline collapses. Their standing army stands at a combined total of around 1,700,000 men with an additional 2,600,000 other reservists. Here is the military statistics listed in order:

| Military Unit Type            | Military Unit Amount (Divisions) | MIlitary Unit Allocated Manpower |
| ----------------------------- | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| Infantry Divisions            |                92                |           837,000 men            |
| Mountaineer Divisions         |                8                 |            54,000 men            |
| Marine Infantry Divisions     |                8                 |            54,000 men            |
| Airborne Assault Divisions    |                4                 |            16,000 men            |
| Mechanized Infantry Divisions |                32                |           256,000 men            |
| Light Armored Divisions       |                32                |           208,000 men            |
| Heavy Armored Divisions       |                24                |           314,000 men            |
| **TOTAL**                     |               200                |          1,739,000 men           |
##### Special case of the National Guard
The union's counter-terrorism and national defense team is an organization called the **National Guard**. It is not under the command of military staff but under the direct command of the **Committee for Central Organization** under the rapid response units along with fire-fighters, police officers and doctors / nurses. They are specially trained to be able to be fully mobilized & deployed within 24-28 hours. They in all total of 108,000 men spread across 24 divisions. The national guard is highly trained in mechanized vehicle operation, military engineering, asymmetrical warfare, cavalry charges and even naval operations. They are a highly trained portion of the army that is capable of both airborne, marine and alpine warfare. They have their own contingent of air power (several fighter-interceptor, close air support and tactical bomber squadrons) and of naval power (several dozen frigates, several destroyers, cruisers and 2 Aircraft Carriers).

#### Navy
The **Segiezian Unified Naval Forces** (SNF) is the major naval force of the Segeizian Union. It operates over 712 combat vessels and commands more than 280,000 men across 4 oceans, covering one continent's coastline. Its large amount of ships allows it to project power globally. Recently, at the advice of General **Alexander Jugens** & Admiral **Jaur Vort**, the union's naval doctrine has shifted to a more carrier-centric, maneuver warfare strategy. It is divided into two theaters (Northern and Southern) and consists of two high seas fleet (**1st Northern** & **2nd Southern High Seas Fleet**) and of two submarine fleets (**1st Northern** & **2nd Southern Submarine Fleet**). 

Ships of the Segiezian Union are marked with different prefixes depending on their purpose. Large ships like Aircraft Carriers, Helicopter Carriers and Battleships are given the prefix ***USR*** (abbr. of the country name), medium size and small ships like Battlecruisers, Cruisers, Destroyers and Frigates are given the prefix ***HCS*** (Honorable Commissioned Ship) while submarines are given the prefix ***SMV*** (Special Marine Vehicle). 
##### Corruption Contrevercies
Analysts note that while the Segiezian Navy remains one of the world’s largest, portions of its fleet are composed of vessels designed in the 1940s and 1950s, making it less modernized compared to some contemporary forces. Additionally, the navy's continued operation of battleships and battlecruisers leave the overall naval structure less maneuverable than contemporary fleets. This is, in part, due to the corruption of **Admiral Alfred A. Sauernbreker**. The Admiral has ties with corruption and nepotism in the military and has profited from the attempts by the wealthier **Ernego Pirate groups** to pay him to turn a blind eye to the frequent pirate raids in the Western region. He is also responsible for the **Ernego Pirates** enlarging their fleet five-fold due to him selling old & unfinished ship hulls to the at a premium. This allowed the **Ernego Pirates** to obtain modern submarine technology which aided them in their raids.

#### Airforce & Space Forces
The **Segiezian Unified Aerial & Space Forces** (SASF) is the major air & space force of the Segeizian Union. It comprises more than 280,000 people counting pilots, ground personnel & maintenance / other support staff. The **SASF** operates over 13,000 aircraft *(Fighter, Close Air Support, Bombers, Reconnaissance, Transport, etc...)* with about 9,650 being active aircraft. The **SASF** (Space Division) is also in charge of the geostationary positioning satellite network, ballistic missiles and most of the substantial nuclear weapon stockpile of the Segiezian Union.

#### General Staff
The **General Staff of the Union of Segiezian Socialist Republics** is the highest military authority of the **Unified Segiezian Command of Naval, Aerial & Ground Operations**, responsible for overseeing operational planning, strategic coordination, and the administration of all military branches. The General Staff is typically composed of **ten senior members**, each representing a major branch or functional command within the armed forces.

In exceptional circumstances, the General Staff may operate with **nine members**, as currently occurs under **Admiral Alfred A. Sauernbreker**, who simultaneously serves as **Chief of All Naval Forces and Assets** and **Chairman of the General Staff & All Military Forces**.  The General Staff is tasked with advising the **Committee for Central Planning** on military policy, coordinating joint operations, directing personnel and logistical matters, and ensuring the readiness and effectiveness of the armed forces. It also plays a pivotal role in shaping doctrine, overseeing defense modernization programs, and maintaining strategic oversight of the country’s military capabilities.

In addition to the General Staff, the Segiezian Armed Forces are led by a number of senior officers holding the rank of **Admiral or General**. These leaders are responsible for the overall direction of their branches, overseeing operations, and ensuring that the strategic goals of the military are carried out effectively. Many also serve as key advisors on defense policy, military planning, and the coordination of joint forces. 

#### Ranks & Titles
The **Unified Segiezian Command of Naval, Aerial, and Ground Operations** employs a structured rank system across its **Army**, **Navy**, **Air Force**, and **National Guard**. This hierarchy delineates the progression of officers from entry-level positions to the highest positions of command. The table below outlines the principal ranks within each branch along with the distinctions and responsibilities associated with each level. Special titles relevant to the **National Guard** and other specialized units are also included to provide a comprehensive overview of the military's organizational structure:

| Rank              | Army                    | Navy                 | Air Force                    | National Guard                       | Notes                                                                                                             |

The birth rate was reported at 22.3 per 1,000 women, with a mortality rate of 8.7 per 1,000 and infant mortality at 12.4 per 1,000. Life expectancy has steadily increased due to state investment in healthcare and public sanitation.

#### Ethnic Groups
Ethnic relations remain a central issue in Union society. Tensions persist between the majority **Zinari** population and the **Yereshadese** minority, rooted in the pre-1958 social order when Zinari communities faced systemic discrimination. While official policy emphasises equality among nationalities, disparities in political influence and cultural representation continue to provoke debate.
