Ernego is a strange political entity. Although it is a recognised country with internationally accepted borders, the polity acts more as a union of big and small pirate families for the sake of political protection and centralisation of authority.

Despite the presence of a nominal government, Ernego is highly decentralised, operating much like Warlord China or Russia during the civil war period. Authority shifts from region to region, and while some pirate leaders are rumoured to hold sway over entire fleets or provinces, others act with near-total autonomy. The Ernego State is held together less by legal order than by a mutual understanding among its factions that central collapse would bring foreign occupation.

Ernego’s economy is mostly based on piracy of ships passing in the Celatic and Aetine Oceans between the Yatelyurt, Rzhian, Lostsian, Oxlightian, Raugardine, Segiezian and even Yazyurtam shores. Despite this, the Ernego government has a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether the pirate raids are tolerated, sanctioned or supported by the central government.

This deliberate ambiguity has caused war to break out, specifically with the Segiezian Union. However, despite the overwhelming numbers of the Union, the Ernego Combined Fleet decisively defeated a Union Carrier Group. This caused the Union to accept a ceasefire deal and establish a demilitarised zone of 20 km deep in Segiezian territory, ending in the major supply hubs of Itzo and Zigarbezil.

The Ernego raids on the north Celatic and south Aetine Oceans have proven especially fruitful, as this is where the equipment that is sold to the Kingdom of Lostsia transfers from Segiezia. It is also the path that Oxlightian trade must pass to send equipment and materials to the Rosehairse Launch Complex, as repairs on the runways are occurring due to damage by a failed landing of a liquid oxygen tanker, which often carries rare metals, specialised equipment, the highest generation digital equipment and many others, which allow the Ernego State to reach a surprising level of military capabilities, especially in terms of naval firepower and naval air support.

This has made one of the most unlikely alliances possible, one between the Ernego Pirates and the Oxlightian Tsardom. 

Nine months ago, Tsar Karol V arranged a meeting with some of the pirate leaders to craft an alliance for them to raid the Lostsian and Segiezian equipment shipping routes more heavily for a payout and the possibility of getting proper naval ships. To which the pirates agreed emphatically. This may bring a new age of maritime piracy and mercenary work on behalf of other nations.
