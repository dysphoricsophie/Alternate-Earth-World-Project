Unlike the fertile and populous lands inherited by his brother, Thorak was left with a large but sparsely populated, decentralised, and impoverished nation, home to just 1.8 million subjects. Much like Longhia, Vallalur experienced a brief period of democratic governance after the partition of the kingdoms and the division of the House of Longhian Vallalur between the two brothers. That experiment collapsed quickly, and both kings were forced to dissolve their assemblies and rule by decree.

Thorak had always felt like the lesser son. He was ridiculed within his family for his physical disabilities, being deaf in one ear and born with anophthalmia, which left him partially blind. Despite these challenges, he was mentally sharp, far more so than his elder brother Zhyran, who frequently suffered from violent tantrums, manic episodes, and signs of schizophrenia. Even so, Zhyran received the greater portion of the kingdom, while Thorak, now known as Thorak IV of Vallalur, had to accept what remained.

Though disadvantaged both physically and politically, Thorak now focuses on a singular goal: to reunify his late motherâ€™s realm and restore peace and unity to the fractured region.
