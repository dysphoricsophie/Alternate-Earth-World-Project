The western zhurakates are in a precarious situation. After the fall of the previous dynasty, each provincial military leader took control of the units stationed in their province and declared themselves zhurak of the whole empire. They still fly their unit emblem animal on their flag, inspired by the high command flag of the old dynasty. Although descended from the same state with the same legal system, their methods of governance vary from warlord to warlord. Some take care of their subjects, some focus on military affairs only, while others rely on banditry and strong-armed tactics to intimidate the population into submission. It will take an experienced and worthy warlord to reunify the old territories of the Great Toprish Zhurakate.

Unlike the others, the Landonian Zhurakate is not ruled by someone claiming to be the sole rightful zhurak, but by a former spiritual leader and renowned aviator turned military commander. He presents himself as a protector of the people, standing against the cruelty of the neighbouring warlords.

To show his goodwill, he allowed the Barian Zhurakate to achieve nominal independence under one of his most trusted commanders, Kasari-ruk, on the condition that a form of democratic rule be established, a condition that was accepted.

Even so, the Landonian heartland has suffered greatly. A fault has split the Kyreran Plains near Linjani and Bunje, and an armed uprising led by General Samayo-zabat threatens the region. Samayo-zabat seeks secession from the Landonian Authority, but refuses to accept any of Murelkan Jilumoâ€™s terms for independence.
