One of the two successor nations came from the split of the United Kingdom of Longhia-Vallalur after the last Empress, Yuzai II, died suddenly from a brain aneurysm without naming an heir. This led to the kingdoms being divided between her two sons, Thorak and Zhyran. Being the eldest, Zhyran inherited Longhia, the larger and more potent of the two realms.

Though weak in the grand scheme of things, Longhia is a much better country to rule over. It is more populous, centralised, developed, and richer than Vallalur. Because of this, Zhyran also gained control over most of the former kingdom’s already meagre armed forces. Despite his severe tantrums and bouts of mania, Zhyran holds the stronger position thanks to the strength of his realm.

However, Zhyran’s psychological issues have severely affected his rule. His manic episodes and bouts of delusion have led to a loss of control over the kingdom’s affairs, allowing his advisors and political rivals to gain significant influence over his dominion. This growing power behind the throne threatens to fracture Longhia even further, risking its collapse into factional chaos.
