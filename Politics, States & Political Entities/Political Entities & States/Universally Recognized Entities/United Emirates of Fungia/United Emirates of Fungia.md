The United Emirates of Fungia is an island nation found in the very east of the Xanthenine Ocean and the western part of the Crosutine Ocean. It is a nation ruled by the tribal councils, who were given back their previous autonomy under the state before the Darkhan Colonisation Efforts by the Treaty of Ziortsa (1958). This treaty established them as an independent nation under the dynasty of the largest emirate of the union.

Under the provisions of the Treaty of Ziortsa, other nations were also given independence from the central government in Kardagan, like the Keseki Confederacy. This meant that both nations had to compete over the scarce resources of the oceanic region, and from this arose a standoff a few years ago over the island Karutai (known as the Kolichimer Captaincy by the Keseki Confederacy) due to ethnic differences. Despite being 98.6% Dutesk, it’s been under Fungian control since the brief 1963 incident. The Keseki still claim it as culturally and historically theirs, but the Fungians argue it was assigned to them by the Treaty of Ziortsa and that their presence guarantees peace.

This incident and the subsequent victory are one of the main propaganda points of Fungia in asserting dominance over the two oceans. Fungia believes it is their duty to reassert their place as protectors of all peoples under the Xanthenine and Crosutine Oceans. They believe it is their duty, as moral superiors to the Keseki degenerate democracy, to protect the peoples of the two oceans from such evil as democratic rule and women’s rights, advocating for a more male-centric, tribal-essentialist view of the world and especially their god-given reverse oases in the sea.
