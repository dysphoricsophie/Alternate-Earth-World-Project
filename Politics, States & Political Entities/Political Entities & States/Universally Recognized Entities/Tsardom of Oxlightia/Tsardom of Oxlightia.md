The Tsardom is truly a strange nation. It is ruled by royal decree yet upholds strong worker protections and embraces worker self-management, making it a red king. Karol V, unlike his father Karol IV, represents a complete break from the past. Karol IV’s death was a traumatic event for the still-underage Karol V. His father caused severe unrest by marrying a non-noble woman and breaking strikes through military mobilisation. In contrast, Karol V is a gentle ruler known for his compassion and understanding toward his people.

During Karol V’s reign, infant mortality, feminicide, and domestic abuse dropped dramatically. His approach was firm and sometimes draconian, but effective and swift in resolving these issues. His iron fist was all-encompassing yet carried a sense of gentle care.

Despite these successes, the Tsardom faces serious challenges. Along with the throne, Karol V inherited escalating tensions with the kingdom of Lostsia, which erupted into war thirteen years ago. Although the Tsardom holds a clear power advantage, the conflict quickly turned into a war of attrition. The last border changes occurred in early June 1984, and since then, the frontlines have remained largely static.

This prolonged war has allowed the Tsar to commission a space centre in the small coastal village of Rosehairse. The goal is to catch up with the Segiezian and Darkhan space programs and assert the Tsardom’s presence in this new arena.
