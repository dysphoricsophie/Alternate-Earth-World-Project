The western zhurakates are in a precarious situation. After the fall of the previous dynasty, each provincial military leader took control of the units stationed in their province and declared themselves zhurak of the whole empire. They still fly their unit emblem animal on their flag, inspired by the high command flag of the old dynasty. Although descended from the same state with the same legal system, their methods of governance vary from warlord to warlord. Some take care of their subjects, some focus on military affairs only, while others rely on banditry and strong-armed tactics to intimidate the population into submission. It will take an experienced and worthy warlord to reunify the old territories of the Great Toprish Zhurakate.  

Among them, the Otynian Zhurakate stands out as the chief military power in the region. It is the strongest of all zhurakates in terms of manpower and equipment. Most of the former state’s military officers have sworn allegiance to him, drawn by the web of alliances he spent four decades building during his service as Chief Minister of the Armoured Forces. Because of this, he commands the largest mechanised force among the zhurakates and the second largest in the entire region.

He plays little role in civil administration, admitting his expertise is in military affairs rather than governance. As a result, most civil and political affairs are handled by one of his closest allies, a political figure 32 years his junior. She is General Jafen-zabati, the only woman to ever hold general rank in the Zhurakate’s history. Although her skills in battlefield command are lacking, her skills in running state affairs are widely respected.
