Being the only nation that still practices feudal ownership, the Onenat Matriarchate is truly a relic from an older time. The country appears to be lagging behind other world powers in technology and social development. It is the sickest man of them all. A nation with a nobility so greedy and wrathful that it could not even try to attenuate its grip on the poor feudal peasants.
The lack of an educated population also means that Onenat faces challenges in finding and recruiting skilled personnel to operate the modern equipment required for warfare.
These systemic issues prevent it from even performing the most basic of military operations. An example of which is the border skirmish that it lost against the far smaller and weaker Mungonian Nation a few years ago.
This nation is neither the worst nor the best. Neither a world power nor a weak nation. Neither a home of the brave nor a land of the coward, a fascinating nation that should have stayed in its era.
