Mungonia is one of the few stable nations with a government that genuinely cares for its people. Being a vassal of the former Kingdom of Pamoriatsa, it too fell to revolutionary ideals. However, unlike Pamoriatsa, which had a more internationalist and liberation-minded socialist revolution, Mungonian revolutionaries focused on the idea of “Socialism in one nation.” They believed that the revolution needed to be perfected within its borders before it could be exported or encouraged elsewhere. This concept of turning a nation into a revolutionary sandbox for experimentation is the core of Mungonian Socialism.

Unlike the more democratic form of socialism practised in the Union, Mungonia is ruled by a Vanguard Party that claims to guide the uneducated proletarian masses toward class consciousness and revolutionary idealism. The nation also maintains a deeply nationalist view of itself, seeing it as its duty to mould the world into its vision of a better and perfectly equal society. In their eyes, that society is Communism.
