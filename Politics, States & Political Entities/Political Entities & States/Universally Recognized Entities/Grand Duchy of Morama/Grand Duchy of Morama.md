The situation is dire. From the northern invasion to the volcanic eruptions in the centre, the outlook is grim. In such times of crisis, the constitution of the duchy grants a special title to a group chosen to lead the nation through military troubles: the “Consilium Rerum Militarium et Civitatis,” meaning the council of military and state affairs. This council holds extraordinary power, superseding the ruling monarch in matters of military affairs, including conscription, civilian defence, and military construction.

The council was appointed by the monarch at the start of the war, following the agreement of five senior military officers. It is composed of between five and ten high ranking military officers, alongside five to ten senior royal advisors.

So far, the duchy has put up a brave fight, but the war has become more attritional than operational. Defences are wearing thin, shortages of manpower and equipment persist, industrial collapse looms, famine threatens, ecological disasters unfold, court politics escalate, and a lack of international support appears to doom the duchy to failure.
