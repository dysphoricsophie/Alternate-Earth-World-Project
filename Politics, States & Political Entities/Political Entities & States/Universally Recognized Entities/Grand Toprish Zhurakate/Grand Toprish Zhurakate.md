Having recently collapsed due to the preceding dynasty’s growing corruption, the Toprish Zhurakate now finds itself reborn under a new Zhurak. The last few zhuraks had been chosen as children and raised under the influence of warring factions within the imperial court, which weakened the dynasty from within and led to its downfall.

The new Zhurak promises to reunite the nation, repeating the cycle of collapse and rebirth that has long shaped the region’s history. However, this time the challenge is greater. Over the past few years, competing regional khanates have been eager to capitalise on the empire’s recent collapse and expand their power.

This need is why the Zhurak has called for the help of experienced men of knightly lineage from all over his domain to aid in the reconquest of the borderlands. Like during the last collapse, the Zhurak will be leading his men to battle, but instead of being on top of his steed, he will be commanding the growling machines of steel and fire.

To restore the great empire’s legacy, the Zhurak will have to face threats both large and small from these outside contenders. At the same time, he must remain cautious of possible betrayals and power struggles within his circle of allies. The path ahead will demand not only strength in battle but also skilful political manoeuvring to rebuild unity and secure his rule.
