Since declaring independence, the Ubang-Jusari State has faced numerous serious issues. The northern and eastern zhurakates eye their territories, ready to expand their influence. Meanwhile, the Holy Darkhan Empire is showing signs of growing desperation, which is increasing the pressure on Ubang-Jusari both politically and militarily. Internally, the government struggles to contain religious extremists sent by the Darkhan State, who aim to destabilise the nation and weaken the central authority.

Despite this challenging situation, the central government remains strong. The economy is outperforming those of all other nations. This economic miracle continues to surprise observers, who repeatedly ask, “How are they doing it?” The nation’s financial success provides a strong foundation that helps it maintain stability through those trials and tribulations.

Besieged from the outside but thriving from within, the Ubang-Jusari State walks a paradoxical tightrope. Though surrounded by dangers on multiple fronts, it manages not only to survive but to thrive. The government appears capable of navigating and even surmounting this complex situation, balancing the competing pressures while maintaining hope for a stable future.
