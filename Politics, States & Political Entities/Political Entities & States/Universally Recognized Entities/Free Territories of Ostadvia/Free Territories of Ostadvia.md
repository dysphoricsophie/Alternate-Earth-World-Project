An experiment in state building and the limits of what a nation can even be, this nation is the wet dream of any anarcho-communist. It is more of a loose confederation, with each person a willing participant and a distinct political unit.

No elections are needed, as there is no representative to elect. No taxes are required, since there is no entity to allocate funds for infrastructure or services. Instead, people work together directly for the common good of their fellow citizens.

This isolated set of islands has given rise to the pinnacle of Marx and Engels' writings, a largely stateless, moneyless, and classless society. True Communism at last.

Despite the challenges of maintaining such a system, this nation continues to function through cooperation, shared responsibility, and voluntary participation. It stands as a living example of what many have long envisioned, pushing the boundaries of political organisation beyond traditional nation-states.
