This nation is the one that most closely resembles the modern ideal of a liberal nation in real life. This nation is one where sexual orientation is accepted, and racism is criminally punished. Other types of discrimination range from being major taboos to being criminally punishable by law. This is a true paradise for all. A nation where your rights are enshrined in the legal system. A true utopian society.

These social equality initiatives have also had the benefit of boosting research capabilities, knowledge of the general public and advancing the medical field (especially in terms of hormone-related issues like endometriosis, male pattern baldness and pituitary conditions). 

As a result of this society, a collection of freely accessible manuscripts on all topics that could ever be thought of, from fiction to erotica, from engineering to art, from sexual health to parenting books, is available near the village of Dampierres, which has recently been expanded with a new four-lane highway and a new metro connection to allow easy access by the population. Unfortunately, there has been a series of earthquakes near the neighbouring village of Letaxambunia, which has caused the national library to be closed for repairs and implementation of anti-earthquake measures.

It isn’t difficult to build a society where people can live comfortably, affordably, and in peace. It really is that simple. There is no need for horrific death cults or totalitarian states watching your every move. A nation like this proves that it is entirely possible to create a place where life is good, where people are treated well, and where things simply work for the betterment of all.
