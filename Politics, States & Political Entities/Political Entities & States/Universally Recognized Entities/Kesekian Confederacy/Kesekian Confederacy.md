The Kesekian Confederacy is a maritime trade republic along the edge of the Xanthenine and Crosutine oceans. It functions as a parliamentary republic with its old tribal courts and administrative apparatuses abolished and formerly banned by the first constitution of the nation in 1960. This came as a result of several large protests in major cities due to the arrest of a powerful tribal leader accused & charged of several counts of sexual assault and statutory rape. This culminated in the parliament building (arm of the non-tribal government) being under a 3-day siege by members of the military that demanded his release.

However, Keseki’s problems haven't only been internal, but external too. One of the biggest threats to Keseki’s territorial integrity is the United Emirates of Fungia. They have for long preached a highly nationalistic view of themselves, in which they are the designated protectors of the islands between the Crosutine and Xanthenine Oceans. This led to an incident where Fungian troops invaded and illegally occupied the island of Kolichimer along with the smaller island of Chetnia to maintain control over the strategic passes that allow goods to go to the west from the Zhurakates to Darkhan without having to go through Yafat or Ubang-Jusari territories.

For being one of the former colonies of Darkhan, Keseki still maintains pretty close economic ties to the nation, serving as a neutral trading point that Darkhan uses to trade with the rest of the world in the Zhurakates of the East, the Vallalur & Longhian Dynasties in the south, and even to trade with the Yatelyurts and Iurunians. Keseki’s large deposits of oil have also been long coveted by Darkhan state actors who have established the United Darkho-Keseki Oil Company (UDKO) to jointly extract these resources.
