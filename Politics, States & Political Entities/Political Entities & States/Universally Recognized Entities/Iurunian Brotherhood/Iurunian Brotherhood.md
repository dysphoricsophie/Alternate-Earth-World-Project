Iurunia and the Circle of Secrets show what could have happened to the Mungonian State. A strong revolutionary clique to improve mankind comes to power under the guise of emergency conditions.

However, unlike Mungonia, the government isn't concerned with other aspects of society that need fixing to achieve a perfect society. Iurunia and the “Brotherhood” instead use their twisted version of Tavyropism to control the masses as a means to reach a purification by blood. A supreme race that cannot and will not be infected by the diseases of other mortals, even if bred with for thousands of years. A true race of supremacy, a perfect one, one with pure genetics, Human 2.0.

This, like in Mungonia, is done through horrific measures. However, Mungonia’s measures may sound like child's play compared to what the Brotherhood forces on the population. Ritual rape of pure virgins, exsanguination of children to feed the veins of the older and more perfect beings, a true nightmare reminiscent of the Handmaid’s Tale, Brave New World and 1984 altogether. A truly nightmarish state.

If that wasn’t enough, children are also raised Sparta-style, where the weaker babies are killed and “recycled” (eaten by the weak, their only rations to fatten them up) and the remaining are taken from their mothers as soon as they are born for the state to raise them to be true killing machines.
