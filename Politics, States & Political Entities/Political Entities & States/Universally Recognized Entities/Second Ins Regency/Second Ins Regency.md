This rump state, a mere shadow of the once-proud empire it was, shows what happens when the fury of defeat is directed outward at the world instead of inward toward its people.
Under the military regency of the child emperor, the new regent seeks to fulfil his dream: a reunified Ins Maritime Superpower.
But this ambition comes at a price: political autonomy. Once a federal republic within the Grand Darkhan Federal Union, the nation now turns back to its former overlord for assistance and a chance to reclaim lost territories.
As if these crises were not enough, a tsunami is sweeping across much of the countryâ€™s coastlines, adding a natural disaster to an already dreadful situation.
