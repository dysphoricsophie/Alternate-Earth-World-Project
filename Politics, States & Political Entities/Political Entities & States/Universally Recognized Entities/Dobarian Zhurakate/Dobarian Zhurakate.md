The western zhurakates are in a precarious situation. After the fall of the previous dynasty, each provincial military leader took control of the units stationed in their province and declared themselves zhurak of the whole empire. They still fly their unit emblem animal on their flag, inspired by the high command flag of the old dynasty. Although descended from the same state with the same legal system, their methods of governance vary from warlord to warlord. Some take care of their subjects, some focus on military affairs only, while others rely on banditry and strong-armed tactics to intimidate the population into submission. It will take an experienced and worthy warlord to reunify the old territories of the Great Toprish Zhurakate.

The Zhurak of Dobaria, Hadrim-rak, is the third in a line of shock legion officers who served under the old Toprish Zhurakate. Unlike his forebears, he did not wait for orders. He killed his superior, took his men, and seized Dobaria when the Great Zhurakate collapsed. Your background mattered not to him; the elderly were dragged and hanged, children were exsanguinated, some were fed to rabid and starving dogs, others were burned alive, while others still were injected with all kinds of chemical concoctions for his own pleasure and curiosity. He named himself Zhurak.

The state he built is not a state. It is a military occupation turned inward. Looters, sadists, and criminals who bent the knee became his officials. Order is kept through patrol squads, limb amputations and slavery till death. There is no law. No record. No council. Only Hadrim-rak’s vices. Punishment follows anyone who speaks, moves, or gathers without his express will.

His officers obey. They have seen what happens when they do not. Hadrim has beaten men to death with his fists. He does not hide it; he flaunts it.
