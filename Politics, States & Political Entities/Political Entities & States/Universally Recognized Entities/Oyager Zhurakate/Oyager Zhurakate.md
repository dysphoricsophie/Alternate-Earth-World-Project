The western zhurakates are in a precarious situation. After the fall of the previous dynasty, each provincial military leader took control of the units stationed in their province and declared themselves zhurak of the whole empire. They still fly their unit emblem animal on their flag, inspired by the high command flag of the old dynasty. Although descended from the same state with the same legal system, their methods of governance vary from warlord to warlord. Some take care of their subjects, some focus on military affairs only, while others rely on banditry and strong-armed tactics to intimidate the population into submission. It will take an experienced and worthy warlord to reunify the old territories of the Great Toprish Zhurakate.

Despite leading the second-largest military clique in the former territories of the Zhurakate, the Oyager Zhurakate has suffered a severe loss of prestige under its tyrannical and wildly inconsistent leader, Zhurak Jilumo-rak. Known to his enemies as the “Artillery Bastard,” he once ordered a relentless bombardment of the home city of one of his many concubines for 600 days straight simply because she had cheated on him.

While utterly incapable of managing civic affairs or ruling a country, Jilumo-rak transforms completely on the battlefield. He is a brilliant strategist, an expert in urban infiltration, and a tactical genius in mechanised warfare. The stark contrast between his ineptitude in governance and his military brilliance is so extreme that it would give any observer whiplash.

His armies, though deeply corrupt, remain a formidable fighting force. This is partly due to his exceptional command and strategies, and also because of the large mechanised contingent fiercely loyal to him. This combination makes Jilumo-rak one of the most dangerous warlords among the former territories of the Great Zhurakate. His unpredictable nature and strategic prowess often compel enemies to sign ceasefire agreements before battles even begin.
