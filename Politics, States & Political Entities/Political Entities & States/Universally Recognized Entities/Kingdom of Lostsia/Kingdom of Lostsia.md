Under the rule of the current king of Oxlighia, Karol V, the nation has found itself at war. In a situation much like that of Morama in the east, which is succumbing to the combined Darkhan forces, Oxlighia faces a fierce opponent. However, Lostsia was far better prepared for the conflict with Oxlighia than Morama was against the Darkhan Empire.

Relations between the two powers were never peaceful. Both fought to colonise the Aurish plains to gain more favourable access to the Western Zhurakates and, in turn, better trade opportunities. Despite being roughly equal in strength, the Oxlightian royal family succeeded in uniting and subduing the Aurish kingdoms through royal marriages and trade agreements. This effectively locked the Lostsians out of the colonial race for the foreseeable future.

These tensions, unresolved by the previous king, worsened after King Karol IVâ€™s passing. His successor, Karol V, escalated the conflict to a military and strategic level, aiming to secure rights to equatorial lands for a launch site. The war began swiftly, with a quick defeat expected, but the Lostians fought valiantly. Lostsia was not yet lost.

Now, more than a decade since the war began, the front lines have remained static for over a year. The Lostians hold the defence. The question remains whether Lostsia can secure a favourable peace or if they are merely delaying the inevitable.
