The western zhurakates are in a precarious situation. After the fall of the previous dynasty, each provincial military leader took control of the units stationed in their province and declared themselves zhurak of the whole empire. They still fly their unit emblem animal on their flag, inspired by the high command flag of the old dynasty. Although descended from the same state with the same legal system, their methods of governance vary from warlord to warlord. Some take care of their subjects, some focus on military affairs only, while others rely on banditry and strong-armed tactics to intimidate the population into submission. It will take an experienced and worthy warlord to reunify the old territories of the Great Toprish Zhurakate.

The Rahran Zhurakate stands apart. Unlike the others, the Rahran Military District is not ruled by a field general, not by a city governor, and not by some accountant turned warlord. It is ruled by a knight. Not just any knight, but Rilan-rak wa-Ruibamu, heir to one of the most respected knightly bloodlines of the Great Plains. His family estate still claims a third of all land inside the walls of Ruibamu, the largest city in the region.

Rilan-rak is not a bandit, nor a reformer, nor a dreamer. He is a noble. He acts like one. His laws are rigid. His soldiers are drilled. His punishments are swift. He does not attack civilian targets. He executes deserters and looters. He does not explain his decisions twice. His people respect him because he keeps order. His officers follow him because he keeps his word. His army is not as large as some others, but it is intact. It has fuel. It has food. Its weapons are older but maintained. Its men are trained.

Rilan-rak wa-Ruibamu is called the Inheritor. Not because he inherited the land, though he did. Not because he inherited the title, though that too. It is because he behaves like he still belongs to the old order. Because he acts like the war never ended. Because he still thinks it this his duty to restore the old order.
