#### *Military Dictatorship*
A **military state** is a political entity in which governance and administration are dominated by armed forces or military leadership. Civilian institutions often exist but are subordinate to military authority.

Military states prioritize defense, security, and order. Policies, laws, and societal organization are heavily influenced by strategic and operational considerations, with a focus on readiness, discipline, and centralized command.

#### *Civilian Dictatorship*
A **civilian dictatorship** is a system in which political power is concentrated in a single individual or a small ruling group without military or religious legitimacy. Authority is exercised directly over the state apparatus, often bypassing traditional democratic institutions.

Civilian dictatorships rely on centralized administration, coercion, and control of political processes to maintain power. They may implement policies unilaterally and often employ propaganda, legal manipulation, or surveillance to suppress dissent while maintaining the appearance of civilian rule.

#### *Military Frontier & Buffer State*
A **military frontier** or **buffer state** is a border region organized primarily for defense against external threats. Its governance is typically militarized, with officers overseeing administration, law, and security.

Military frontiers serve as protective zones between major powers, integrating fortifications, garrisons, and settlers into strategic defense networks. These regions often develop distinct social and administrative structures adapted to their martial role.

#### *National Order*
A **national order** is a structured organization, often military or paramilitary, that exercises authority over a territory or population. Leadership is hierarchical, with clear ranks and responsibilities.

National orders combine governance, enforcement, and ceremonial functions. They may enforce national laws, maintain internal security, or serve as elite military formations with both administrative and martial authority.

#### *Authority*
An **authority**, in the context of a regional military command, is a governing body whose power is derived from military control rather than civilian structures. It typically administers territory for defense, strategic oversight, and security purposes.

These authorities may regulate local resources, enforce laws, and maintain armed forces within their region. Their legitimacy is closely tied to operational effectiveness and loyalty to the central command.

#### *Commandery*
A **commandery** is a territorial division governed by a military-appointed administrator, often with authority over both civil and martial matters. Commanders oversee law, taxation, and defense within the region.

Commanderies are typically organized for efficient administration of conquered or frontier territories. They provide a framework for centralized control, military readiness, and integration of local populations into a larger polity.

#### *Transitional Authority & Temporary Exclusive Authority*
A **transitional authority** or **temporary exclusive authority** is a provisional governance system established to administer a region during periods of military occupation, crisis, or transition.

These authorities exercise full control over law, security, and administration for a limited period. Their purpose is to maintain order, enforce directives, and prepare the region for stable governance, often prioritizing military and security concerns over civilian participation.
