#### *Client State*
A **client state** is a polity that maintains formal sovereignty but is heavily influenced or controlled by a more powerful state. Its foreign policy, defense, or economic decisions are often subject to external pressure or guidance.

Client states typically retain internal administration and governance structures, but their strategic autonomy is limited. They may serve as buffer zones, allies, or economic partners for the controlling state, with loyalty enforced through treaties, military presence, or financial dependence.

#### *Tributary State*
A **tributary state** is a political entity that maintains formal independence but regularly provides tribute such as goods, money, or military support to a dominant power in exchange for protection or diplomatic recognition.

Tributary relationships are often part of broader networks of hierarchy and diplomacy. While the subordinate state may retain significant internal autonomy, its obligations reinforce the supremacy of the dominant power and shape regional political dynamics.

#### *Fiefdom*
A **fiefdom** is a landholding granted by a lord to a vassal in exchange for loyalty and service, usually military. It forms the foundation of feudal systems, linking governance and territorial control with personal obligations.

Fiefdoms vary widely in size and authority. Powerful fiefdoms may rival their lords in influence, and vassals often participate in regional politics, manage local administration, and oversee justice and taxation within their holdings.

#### *Viceroyalty*
A **viceroyalty** is a territory governed by a viceroy acting on behalf of a distant sovereign. Viceroys oversee administration, law, taxation, and defense, often exercising near-sovereign authority.

Viceroyalties are common in large empires or overseas possessions. They allow central authorities to manage distant territories efficiently while delegating significant powers to locally stationed officials.

#### *Principality / Voivodate*
A **principality** or **voivodate** is a territorial unit ruled by a prince or voivode, often under the nominal authority of a higher sovereign. These polities may exercise significant autonomy in local governance, military command, and administration.

Principalities and voivodates often emerge from fragmented states or frontier regions. They may gain influence through strategic alliances, dynastic marriages, or economic control, and sometimes evolve into fully sovereign states.

---
#### *Provisional Government, Transitional Authority & Interim Administration*
A **provisional government**, **transitional authority**, or **interim administration** is a temporary political entity established to manage governance during periods of transition, crisis, or political restructuring.

These administrations typically maintain law and order, oversee elections or reforms, and prepare the state for permanent governance structures. Their authority is often limited by mandate, time, or external oversight, and stability depends on effective coordination and legitimacy.

---
#### *Sister & Brother Republic*
A **sister** or **brother republic** is a political entity established or supported by another state, often sharing ideological, legal, or constitutional frameworks. These republics frequently emerge during revolutionary or expansionist periods.

While formally independent, sister and brother republics often maintain close diplomatic, military, or economic ties with their founding or sponsoring state. They serve as allies or extensions of influence while promoting shared political principles.

---
#### *Satellite State*
A **satellite state** is a formally independent country whose political, economic, or military policies are heavily influenced or directed by a more powerful nation.

Satellite states often rely on the dominant power for security or economic support. While retaining nominal sovereignty, their foreign policy and strategic decisions are frequently aligned with the controlling stateâ€™s interests.

---
#### *Condominium*
A **condominium** is a territory jointly administered by two or more sovereign powers. Governance is shared, often through cooperative legal, administrative, and military arrangements.

Condominiums balance competing interests, requiring coordination and negotiation between authorities. They often emerge in contested regions or areas of mutual economic or strategic importance.

---
#### *Dependency, Mandate, Occupied & Trust Territories*
A **dependency**, **mandatory state**, **occupied territory**, or **trust territory** is a political unit under the control or supervision of an external authority. The administering power exercises varying degrees of governance while obligations and sovereignty may be partially retained by the local population.

These territories are usually subject to international agreements, legal frameworks, or temporary arrangements. Administration can involve civil governance, security enforcement, or economic management, and the future status may include independence or integration.

---
#### *Associate State*
An **associate state** is a polity that retains internal autonomy while forming a formal association with a larger sovereign, often in areas such as defense, foreign policy, or economic cooperation.

Associate states maintain legal and administrative independence but typically agree to coordinate on strategic matters. This arrangement allows smaller polities to benefit from protection, trade, or diplomatic support without fully ceding sovereignty.

---
#### *Crown Colony*
A **crown colony** is a territory directly governed by a monarch or central authority, typically with little local self-rule. Officials are appointed to oversee administration, law, and economic activity.

Crown colonies often hold strategic, economic, or military importance. Their governance reflects the priorities of the sovereign rather than local populations, sometimes fostering tensions or unique local cultures.
