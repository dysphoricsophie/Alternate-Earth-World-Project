### *Kingdom*
A **kingdom** is a monarchical state ruled by a king or queen, typically hereditary. It forms the central political unit in a region, combining symbolic authority with practical governance over its lands and subjects. Kingdoms often encompass multiple subordinate territories, including counties, duchies, or principalities, which may be semi-autonomous.

Kingdoms are characterized by dynastic succession, aristocratic hierarchies, and centralized administration. They often rely on noble alliances, taxation systems, and military forces to maintain control. Cultural identity, legal codes, and religious institutions frequently play a central role in reinforcing the authority of the monarchy.

### *Despotate*
A **despotate** is a polity governed by a despot, typically a regional ruler operating under nominal imperial or royal oversight. Despotates often emerge in frontier or contested regions where strong, centralized authority is required.

Despotates blend military, administrative, and judicial functions, with rulers wielding significant local autonomy. They frequently serve as buffer zones between larger states and can become influential cultural or military centers. Their titles often convey prestige without implying tyranny.

### *Duchy & Grand Duchy*
A **duchy** is a territory ruled by a duke or duchess, while a **grand duchy** is generally larger or more prestigious. These polities exist within broader monarchies or empires but often maintain substantial self-governance.

### *Empire & Tsardom*
An **empire** or **tsardom** is a political entity encompassing multiple territories, peoples, or polities under a single sovereign, usually an emperor or tsar. Empires govern through centralized authority combined with local administration to manage diversity and distance while tsardoms tend to use a combination of their centralized authority & theological power held by the sovereign to manage the nation.

They often rely on a combination of military strength, bureaucracy, taxation, and diplomacy to maintain cohesion. Cultural integration, trade networks, and religious policies play significant roles in sustaining imperial authority across vast regions.

A **Zhurakate** is a state led by a zhurak, frequently arising from nomadic or steppe traditions. They unite multiple tribes or clans under a single leadership, balancing military control with delegated authority.

### *Shogunate*
A **shogunate** is a military government led by a shogun, with a nominal monarch serving primarily ceremonial functions. Authority rests on military organization, loyalty networks, and administrative oversight.

### *Dynastic State*
A **dynastic state** or **state dynasty** is a polity defined by hereditary rule, where the ruling family embodies political legitimacy. The continuity of the state depends on the success of succession and the prestige of the dynasty.

These states often expand influence through marriage alliances, conquest, or diplomatic negotiation. The authority of the ruling house may transcend individual territories, linking otherwise disparate regions under a common family identity.

### *Integral State*
An **integral state** centralizes authority to maintain unity, reducing regional autonomy. This structure prioritizes cohesion and uniform governance across diverse territories.

Integral states often emerge to counter secessionist movements or regional fragmentation. Strong institutions, standardized laws, and centralized bureaucracy are key to sustaining their stability.
