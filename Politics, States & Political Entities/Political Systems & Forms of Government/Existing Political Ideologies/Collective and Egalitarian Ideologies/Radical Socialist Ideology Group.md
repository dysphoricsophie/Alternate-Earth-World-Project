**Marxism** = A theory and method of societal analysis derived from Karl Marx. It focuses on class struggle, advocating the overthrow of capitalism through a proletarian revolution to establish a classless, stateless society. Marxism emphasizes historical materialism, the idea that economic structures shape society, and the eventual transition to socialism and communism.

**Broad Communism** = A generalized form of communism that prioritizes collective ownership and the abolition of private property, but may incorporate a wider range of policies and interpretations than orthodox Marxism. It focuses on equality, wealth redistribution, and social welfare, without necessarily adhering strictly to revolutionary tactics or Marxist theory.

**Religious Socialism** = A form of socialism that blends traditional religious values with socialist principles. It interprets the moral teachings of a faith (e.g., Christianity, Buddhism) as supportive of social equality, communal welfare, and economic justice, framing socialism as a moral or spiritual duty rather than purely political or economic.

**Market Socialism** = An economic system that combines social ownership (state, cooperative, or public) with market mechanisms. Unlike traditional socialism, it allows supply, demand, and competition to determine prices while keeping profits and resources collectively owned or socially controlled.

**Anarcho-Communitarianism** = A philosophy combining anarchism and communitarian socialism. It envisions decentralized, self-governing communities with communal ownership of resources. Authority is minimized, and social norms emphasize mutual aid, cooperation, and participatory decision-making.

**Socialist Monarchism** = A rare ideology that fuses socialist principles with monarchical governance. It proposes a monarchy that actively supports social welfare, wealth redistribution, and worker rights, often justifying socialism as a duty of the sovereign to care for the people.

**Paternal Socialism** = A variant of socialism emphasizing a hierarchical, paternalistic role of the state or leadership in guiding and protecting citizens. It supports social welfare, economic planning, and collective well-being, but frames it as stewardship rather than grassroots empowerment.

**Left Eusocialism** = Inspired by biological eusociality (seen in ants, bees, etc.), this ideology advocates extreme social cohesion, division of labor, and prioritization of the community over individuals. Individual desires are subordinated to collective goals, and strict cooperation is emphasized to achieve societal efficiency.

**Technocratic Utopianism** = A vision of socialism guided by expert planning and technology. It emphasizes rational, scientific management of society to eliminate inequality, improve living standards, and optimize resources. The focus is less on ideology and more on achieving a highly efficient, equitable, and technologically advanced society.
