**Agrarian Socialism** = A socialist system focused on land reform and rural collectivization. It prioritizes collective ownership of agricultural land, state-directed farming policies, and mobilization of the peasantry under centralized control to achieve social equality and economic self-sufficiency.

**Anarcho Communism** = A variant of communism advocating the abolition of the state, hierarchy, and private property in favor of fully communal ownership. In a totalist context, this could be interpreted as extreme collectivization with the goal of eliminating class distinctions, though in practice it usually conflicts with authoritarian control.

**Autocratic Socialism** = Socialism implemented under a centralized, authoritarian leadership. It combines strict top-down governance with socialist economic policies, enforcing collective ownership, state planning, and suppression of dissent to achieve rapid social and economic transformation.

**Social Futurism** = An ideology focused on technologically-driven social transformation. It emphasizes central planning and state-directed innovation to achieve a highly industrialized, modernized, and equitable society, often paired with authoritarian control to implement rapid change.

**Social Progressivism** = A top-down approach to progressive social reform, implemented by a strong central authority. It stresses modernization, education, equality, and social welfare while relying on state power to enforce policies and maintain order.

**Internationalism** = In this context, the promotion of global socialist unity under a centralized or hegemonic authority. It advocates coordination among nations to spread socialism worldwide, often through ideological influence, alliances, or revolutionary movements.

**Left Populism** = Authoritarian socialist ideology that appeals directly to the “masses” or working class, often bypassing traditional institutions. It emphasizes redistribution, collective welfare, and mobilization of popular support to legitimize strong centralized governance.

**Military Communism** = A form of socialism emphasizing state control of the economy and society during times of crisis, often with martial discipline. It includes forced requisitioning, centralized production, and strict regulation of labor to achieve rapid economic mobilization, historically seen in wartime Bolshevik policies.
